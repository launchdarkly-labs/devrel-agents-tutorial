    # Dragon Care
    "Dragon feeding schedule: Adult dragons require 3 sheep per day, served at dawn, noon, and dusk. Baby dragons eat only virgin wool and golden apples.",
    "Dragon fire safety: Keep your dragon's flame regulated with daily mint leaf supplements. Overheated dragons may accidentally incinerate the mailman.",
    "Dragon grooming: Scale polishing should be done weekly with crushed diamonds. Never use regular metal polish as it causes scale rust.",
    "Dragon exercise: Flight training requires minimum 50 acres. Urban dragons can use tall buildings but check local airspace regulations first.",
    "Dragon sleeping arrangements: Treasure hoards make excellent bedding. Minimum 1000 gold coins for comfort, though they'll accept cryptocurrency.",
    "Dragon medical care: Veterinarians specializing in reptilian fire-breathers are rare. Keep emergency numbers for magical healers on speed dial.",
    
    # Phoenix Care
    "Phoenix rebirth cycles: Every 500 years your phoenix will self-immolate. Prepare fireproof nesting materials and have insurance paperwork ready.",
    "Phoenix diet: Cinnamon sticks, star anise, and phoenix tears (ethically sourced). Avoid spicy foods as they cause premature combustion.",
    "Phoenix feather collection: Molted feathers have healing properties. Store in temperature-controlled vault - they spontaneously combust at room temperature.",

    "Phoenix behavioral issues: Excessive preening may indicate low self-esteem. Consider phoenix therapy or motivational speaking workshops.",

    "Unicorn behavioral training: Unicorns are naturally stubborn. Positive reinforcement with pure sugar crystals works better than traditional methods.",

    "Pegasus flying lessons: Natural instinct but requires confidence building. Start with short hops over soft landing areas.",
    "Pegasus dietary restrictions: Cloud-touched oats and sky-water only. Earth-based foods cause wing heaviness and grounding issues.",
    "Pegasus stable requirements: Elevated stables with cloud-level access preferred. Ground-level housing causes claustrophobia.",
    "Pegasus weather sensitivity: Cannot fly during storms - wings conduct electricity. Always check weather before planning aerial outings.",
    
    # Kelpie Care
    "Kelpie water requirements: Minimum 1000-gallon saltwater pool, changed weekly. Chlorine causes scale irritation and temperament issues.",
