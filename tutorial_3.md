# Proving ROI with Data-Driven AI Agent Experiments

## Overview

You've built a sophisticated multi-agent system with smart targeting and premium research tools. But here's what every AI product manager faces: stakeholders need concrete proof that advanced features deliver measurable value. They want to see hard numbers showing that premium search tools increase user satisfaction and that expensive models use resources more efficiently.

*Part 3 of 3 of the series: **Chaos to Clarity: Defensible AI Systems That Deliver on Your Goals***

The solution? **Rigorous A/B experiments** with specific hypotheses, statistical thresholds, and clear success criteria. Instead of guessing which configurations work better, you'll run two strategic experiments that prove ROI with scientific rigor: tool implementation impact and model efficiency analysis.

## What You'll Prove Today

In the next 25 minutes, you'll design and execute experiments that answer two critical business questions:

- **Tool Implementation ROI**: Which tool configuration delivers the best satisfaction-to-cost ratio while maintaining <2s response latency?
- **Model Efficiency Analysis**: Does Claude 3.5 Sonnet use ≥25% fewer tool calls than GPT-4 while maintaining equivalent satisfaction?

## Experiment 1: Tool Implementation ROI (12 minutes)

This experiment answers the fundamental question: "Do advanced search features justify their development cost?"

### **Multi-Variant Hypothesis Framework**

**Primary Hypothesis**: Advanced tool configurations will improve satisfaction while maintaining acceptable cost and latency trade-offs

**Test Variations** (25% traffic each):
- **Control**: `search_v1` only (baseline cost and performance)
- **Treatment A**: `search_v2 + reranking` (advanced internal tools)
- **Treatment B**: `search_v2 + reranking + arxiv_search + semantic_scholar` (full stack)
- **Treatment C**: `arxiv_search + semantic_scholar` only (external tools isolation test)

**Success Criteria** (all must be met):
- ≥15% satisfaction improvement vs control with >90% posterior probability
- Cost increase ≤20% per query with >90% posterior probability
- Response latency ≤2.0 seconds (95th percentile) with >90% posterior probability
- Minimum 100 interactions per variation (400+ total) for reliable Bayesian inference

**Failure Criteria** (any triggers failure):
- <10% satisfaction improvement or <70% posterior probability of improvement
- >25% cost increase per query with >70% posterior probability
- >2.5 seconds response latency (95th percentile) with >70% posterior probability
- If failed: Maintain control configuration, analyze cost/performance bottlenecks

### **Step 1: Create Multi-Metric Framework in LaunchDarkly (5 minutes)**

Create three metrics to track satisfaction, cost, and latency:

**Metric 1: User Satisfaction Rate**
1. **Go to Metrics**: In your LaunchDarkly dashboard, click "Metrics" in the left sidebar
2. **Create New Metric**: Click "Create metric"
3. **Configure Primary Metric**:
   - **Name**: "User Satisfaction Rate"
   - **Key**: "user_satisfaction"
   - **Event Key**: Use the feedback events from your `/feedback` API endpoint
   - **Measurement**: "Conversion rate" (percentage of positive feedback)
   - **Success Event**: When `feedback` field equals "positive"

**Metric 2: Cost per Query**
1. **Create Second Metric**: Click "Create metric"
2. **Configure Cost Counter-Metric**:
   - **Name**: "Average Cost per Query"
   - **Key**: "query_cost"
   - **Event Key**: Use cost tracking events from tool usage
   - **Measurement**: "Average value" (average API cost per interaction)
   - **Lower is Better**: Check this option

**Metric 3: Response Latency**
1. **Create Third Metric**: Click "Create metric"
2. **Configure Latency Metric**:
   - **Name**: "95th Percentile Response Time"
   - **Key**: "response_latency"
   - **Event Key**: Use timing events from your system
   - **Measurement**: "95th percentile" (latency threshold)
   - **Lower is Better**: Check this option

### **Step 2: Set Up Multi-Variant Tool Comparison (6 minutes)**

1. **Navigate to AI Configs**: Go to "AI Configs" → "support-agent"
2. **Create Experiment**: Click "Create experiment"
3. **Experiment Setup**:

   - **Hypothesis**: "Advanced tool configurations improve satisfaction within cost/latency constraints"
   - **Primary Metric**: "User Satisfaction Rate"
   - **Counter-Metrics**: "Average Cost per Query", "95th Percentile Response Time"

4. **Configure Four Variations** (25% traffic each):
   - **Control**: Tools = `["search_v1"]` (baseline)
   - **Treatment A**: Tools = `["search_v2", "reranking"]` (advanced internal)
   - **Treatment B**: Tools = `["search_v2", "reranking", "arxiv_search", "semantic_scholar"]` (full stack)
   - **Treatment C**: Tools = `["arxiv_search", "semantic_scholar"]` (external only)

5. **Set Multi-Criteria Success Thresholds**:
   - **Primary**: ≥15% satisfaction improvement (any treatment vs control)
   - **Cost Constraint**: ≤20% cost increase per query
   - **Latency Constraint**: ≤2.0s response time (95th percentile)
   - **Bayesian Confidence**: >90% posterior probability for success criteria
   - **Sample Size**: 100 interactions minimum per variation (400+ total)

### **Step 3: Launch and Monitor (2 minutes)**

1. **Review Experiment**: Verify all settings match your hypothesis
2. **Start Experiment**: Click "Start experiment"
3. **Monitor Progress**: Track sample size and early results in "Results" tab

### **Step 4: Decision Framework (3 minutes)**

After reaching statistical significance:

**If SUCCESS (≥20% improvement, p<0.05)**:
- **Action**: Roll out `search_v2 + reranking` to all users
- **Business Impact**: Calculate satisfaction improvement × user base × retention value

**If FAILURE (<10% improvement or p>0.05)**:
- **Action**: Keep `search_v1`, investigate search quality issues
- **Business Impact**: Avoid wasted resources on ineffective advanced search

**If INCONCLUSIVE (10-19% improvement)**:
- **Action**: Extend test duration or increase sample size
- **Decision**: Re-evaluate cost/benefit threshold

## Experiment 2: Model Efficiency Analysis (13 minutes)

This experiment quantifies which model delivers better resource efficiency: "Does Claude Sonnet use tools more precisely than GPT-4?"

### **Rigorous Hypothesis Framework**

**Primary Hypothesis**: Claude 3.5 Sonnet will use ≥25% fewer tool calls than GPT-4 to achieve equivalent satisfaction rates

**Counter-Hypothesis**: If Claude uses >90% of GPT-4's tool calls, efficiency gains don't justify model switching costs

**Success Criteria**:
- ≥25% reduction in tool calls with >90% posterior probability
- Maintained satisfaction (within 5% of GPT-4) with >90% posterior probability
- Minimum 100 interactions per model for reliable Bayesian inference

**Failure Criteria**:
- <15% tool call reduction with >70% posterior probability
- >10% satisfaction drop with >70% posterior probability
- If failed: Stick with current model allocation, investigate Claude's tool-calling patterns

### **Step 1: Create Tool Efficiency Metric (3 minutes)**

1. **Create Second Metric**: In LaunchDarkly "Metrics"
2. **Configure Tool Efficiency**:
   - **Name**: "Average Tool Calls per Query"
   - **Key**: "tool_efficiency"
   - **Event Key**: Use tool call events from your system
   - **Measurement**: "Average value" (average number of tools used)
   - **Lower is Better**: Check this option (fewer tool calls = better efficiency)

### **Step 2: Design Model Comparison Experiment (5 minutes)**

1. **Create New Experiment**: On `support-agent` AI Config
2. **Experiment Configuration**:
   - **Name**: "Model Efficiency Analysis"
   - **Type**: "AI Config experiment"
   - **Hypothesis**: "Claude Sonnet uses ≥25% fewer tools with equivalent satisfaction"
   - **Primary Metric**: "Average Tool Calls per Query"
   - **Secondary Metric**: "User Satisfaction Rate"

3. **Configure Model Variations**:
   - **Control (50%)**: Model = "gpt-4", Tools = `["search_v2", "reranking", "arxiv_search", "semantic_scholar"]`
   - **Treatment (50%)**: Model = "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022", Tools = `["search_v2", "reranking", "arxiv_search", "semantic_scholar"]`
   - **Keep identical**: Same instructions, same user targeting, same tool access

4. **Set Dual Success Criteria**:
   - **Efficiency Target**: ≥25% fewer tool calls by Claude
   - **Quality Maintenance**: Satisfaction within 5% of GPT-4 levels

### **Step 3: Bayesian Design Configuration (2 minutes)**

Configure advanced experiment settings:

1. **Sample Size**: 100 interactions minimum per model for reliable Bayesian inference
2. **Test Duration**: 7 days minimum to account for usage patterns
3. **Confidence Threshold**: >90% posterior probability for both efficiency and quality metrics
4. **Decision Framework**: LaunchDarkly's Bayesian analysis will provide probability distributions for each metric

### **Step 4: Launch Dual-Metric Experiment (3 minutes)**

1. **Pre-Launch Checklist**:
   - ✓ Both models have identical tool access
   - ✓ Instructions are identical between variations
   - ✓ User targeting is consistent
   - ✓ Both metrics are properly configured

2. **Start Experiment**: Launch with dual success criteria
3. **Monitor Both Metrics**: Track tool efficiency AND satisfaction rates

## Generate Realistic Test Traffic

Create authentic experiment data with your traffic generator:

```bash
# Generate realistic traffic for statistical significance
uv run python tools/traffic_generator.py --queries 200 --delay 1

# Focus on research queries to test tool efficiency
uv run python tools/traffic_generator.py --queries 150 --delay 1.5
```

**Important**: The traffic generator now uses realistic feedback patterns based on actual response quality, not artificial hypothesis validation.

## Analyzing Results with Scientific Rigor

### **Statistical Analysis Framework**

**LaunchDarkly Bayesian Analysis**:
- **Multi-Variant Comparison**: Bayesian posterior distributions for each variation
- **Probability of Success**: LaunchDarkly calculates probability each treatment beats control
- **Credible Intervals**: 95% credible intervals for satisfaction, cost, and latency metrics
- **Expected Value**: Posterior mean estimates for each metric across variations
- **Decision Confidence**: LaunchDarkly provides confidence scores for variant selection

**For Multi-Variant Tool Implementation**:
- **Satisfaction Analysis**: Probability each variant improves satisfaction >15% vs control
- **Cost Constraint**: Probability cost increase stays <20% vs control
- **Latency Threshold**: Probability 95th percentile latency stays <2.0s
- **Combined Decision**: Select variant with highest probability of meeting all criteria

**For Model Efficiency Experiment**:
- **Efficiency Analysis**: Bayesian comparison of tool call distributions
- **Quality Maintenance**: Posterior probability satisfaction stays within 5% of GPT-4
- **Resource Optimization**: Expected value of cost savings from tool reduction

### **Business Impact Calculation**

**Multi-Variant Tool Implementation ROI**:
```
Net ROI = (Satisfaction Gain × User Base × Retention Value) - (Cost Increase × Query Volume)
Example: (20% × 10,000 × $50) - (15% × $0.50 × 100,000/year) = $100,000 - $7,500 = $92,500 net
```

**Latency Impact Assessment**:
```
User Retention Impact = Latency Increase × Bounce Rate Factor × User Base
Example: 0.5s increase × 2% bounce rate × 10,000 users = 200 users lost annually
```

**Model Efficiency Savings**:
```
Tool Call Reduction × API Cost per Call × Query Volume = Cost Savings
Example: 30% × $0.02 × 50,000 calls/month = $300/month savings
```

## Decision Framework: What Success Looks Like

### **Clear Success Criteria**

**Tool Implementation - DEPLOY** if:
- ✓ ≥20% satisfaction improvement
- ✓ Statistical significance (p<0.05)

**Model Efficiency - SWITCH** if:
- ✓ ≥25% tool call reduction
- ✓ Satisfaction maintained (within 5%)
- ✓ Statistical significance on both metrics
- **Action**: Switch to Claude Sonnet for cost efficiency

### **Clear Failure Criteria**

**Tool Implementation - REJECT** if:
- ✗ <10% satisfaction improvement
- ✗ No statistical significance
- **Action**: Maintain `search_v1`, investigate search quality issues

**Model Efficiency - MAINTAIN STATUS QUO** if:
- ✗ <15% tool call reduction
- ✗ >10% satisfaction drop
- **Action**: Keep current model allocation
