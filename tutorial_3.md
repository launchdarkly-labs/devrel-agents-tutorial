# Proving ROI with Data-Driven AI Agent Experiments

## Overview

You've built a sophisticated multi-agent system with smart targeting and premium research tools. But here's what every AI product manager faces: stakeholders need concrete proof that advanced features deliver measurable value. They want to see hard numbers showing that premium search tools increase user satisfaction and that expensive models use resources more efficiently.

*Part 3 of 3 of the series: **Chaos to Clarity: Defensible AI Systems That Deliver on Your Goals***

The solution? **Rigorous A/B experiments** with specific hypotheses, statistical thresholds, and clear success criteria. Instead of guessing which configurations work better, you'll run two strategic experiments that prove ROI with scientific rigor: tool implementation impact and model efficiency analysis.

## What You'll Prove Today

In the next 25 minutes, you'll design and execute experiments that answer two critical business questions:

- **Tool Implementation ROI**: Does `search_v2 + reranking` improve user satisfaction by ≥20% vs basic `search_v1`?
- **Model Efficiency Analysis**: Does Claude Sonnet use ≥25% fewer tool calls than GPT-4 while maintaining equivalent satisfaction?

Each experiment includes rigorous hypotheses, statistical significance requirements, and clear success/failure thresholds for data-driven decisions.

## Prerequisites

## Experiment 1: Tool Implementation ROI (12 minutes)

This experiment answers the fundamental question: "Do advanced search features justify their development cost?"

### **Rigorous Hypothesis Framework**

**Primary Hypothesis**: Users with `search_v2 + reranking` will show ≥20% higher satisfaction rate compared to `search_v1` baseline

**Counter-Hypothesis**: If satisfaction improvement is <10%, advanced search tools don't justify development cost

**Success Criteria**:
- ≥20% satisfaction improvement with statistical significance (p<0.05)
- Minimum 100 interactions per variation
- Test duration: 7 days minimum

**Failure Criteria**:
- <10% improvement or no statistical significance after 200+ interactions
- If failed: Revert to `search_v1`, investigate why advanced search underperformed

### **Step 1: Create Metrics in LaunchDarkly (3 minutes)**

### **Step 4: Decision Framework (3 minutes)**

After reaching statistical significance:

**If SUCCESS (≥20% improvement, p<0.05)**:
- **Action**: Roll out `search_v2 + reranking` to all users
- **Business Impact**: Calculate satisfaction improvement × user base × retention value

**If FAILURE (<10% improvement or p>0.05)**:
- **Action**: Keep `search_v1`, investigate search quality issues
- **Business Impact**: Avoid wasted resources on ineffective advanced search

**If INCONCLUSIVE (10-19% improvement)**:
- **Action**: Extend test duration or increase sample size
- **Decision**: Re-evaluate cost/benefit threshold

## Experiment 2: Model Efficiency Analysis (13 minutes)

This experiment quantifies which model delivers better resource efficiency: "Does Claude Sonnet use tools more precisely than GPT-4?"

### **Rigorous Hypothesis Framework**

**Primary Hypothesis**: Claude Sonnet will use ≥25% fewer tool calls than GPT-4 to achieve equivalent satisfaction rates

**Counter-Hypothesis**: If Claude uses >90% of GPT-4's tool calls, efficiency gains don't justify model switching costs

**Success Criteria**:
- ≥25% reduction in tool calls with maintained satisfaction (within 5% of GPT-4)
- Statistical significance on both metrics (p<0.05)
- Minimum 100 interactions per model

**Failure Criteria**:
- <15% tool call reduction or >10% satisfaction drop
- If failed: Stick with current model allocation, investigate Claude's tool-calling patterns

### **Step 1: Create Tool Efficiency Metric (3 minutes)**

1. **Create Second Metric**: In LaunchDarkly "Metrics"
2. **Configure Tool Efficiency**:
   - **Name**: "Average Tool Calls per Query"
   - **Key**: "tool_efficiency"
   - **Event Key**: Use tool call events from your system
   - **Measurement**: "Average value" (average number of tools used)
   - **Lower is Better**: Check this option (fewer tool calls = better efficiency)

### **Step 2: Design Model Comparison Experiment (5 minutes)**

1. **Create New Experiment**: On `support-agent` AI Config
2. **Experiment Configuration**:
   - **Name**: "Model Efficiency Analysis"
   - **Type**: "AI Config experiment"
   - **Hypothesis**: "Claude Sonnet uses ≥25% fewer tools with equivalent satisfaction"
   - **Primary Metric**: "Average Tool Calls per Query"
   - **Secondary Metric**: "User Satisfaction Rate"

3. **Configure Model Variations**:
   - **Control (50%)**: Model = "gpt-4", Tools = `["search_v2", "reranking", "arxiv_search", "semantic_scholar"]`
   - **Treatment (50%)**: Model = "claude-3-sonnet-20240229", Tools = `["search_v2", "reranking", "arxiv_search", "semantic_scholar"]`
   - **Keep identical**: Same instructions, same user targeting, same tool access

4. **Set Dual Success Criteria**:
   - **Efficiency Target**: ≥25% fewer tool calls by Claude
   - **Quality Maintenance**: Satisfaction within 5% of GPT-4 levels

### **Step 3: Statistical Design (2 minutes)**

Configure advanced experiment settings:

1. **Sample Size Calculation**: 100 interactions minimum per model for 80% statistical power
2. **Test Duration**: 7 days minimum to account for usage patterns
3. **Significance Level**: p<0.05 for both primary and secondary metrics
4. **Multiple Comparison Correction**: Bonferroni correction for dual metrics

### **Step 4: Launch Dual-Metric Experiment (3 minutes)**

1. **Pre-Launch Checklist**:
   - ✓ Both models have identical tool access
   - ✓ Instructions are identical between variations
   - ✓ User targeting is consistent
   - ✓ Both metrics are properly configured

2. **Start Experiment**: Launch with dual success criteria
3. **Monitor Both Metrics**: Track tool efficiency AND satisfaction rates

## Generate Realistic Test Traffic

Create authentic experiment data with your traffic generator:

```bash
# Generate realistic traffic for statistical significance
uv run python tools/traffic_generator.py --queries 200 --delay 1

# Focus on research queries to test tool efficiency
uv run python tools/traffic_generator.py --queries 150 --delay 1.5
```

**Important**: The traffic generator now uses realistic feedback patterns based on actual response quality, not artificial hypothesis validation.

## Analyzing Results with Scientific Rigor

### **Statistical Analysis Framework**

**For Tool Implementation Experiment**:
- **Primary Analysis**: Chi-square test on satisfaction rates between variations
- **Effect Size**: Calculate Cohen's h for practical significance
- **Confidence Intervals**: 95% CI on satisfaction rate difference

**For Model Efficiency Experiment**:
- **Efficiency Analysis**: Two-sample t-test on tool calls per query
- **Quality Analysis**: Chi-square test on satisfaction rates
- **Combined Decision**: Both criteria must meet thresholds for success

### **Business Impact Calculation**

**Tool Implementation ROI**:
```
Satisfaction Improvement × User Base × Retention Value = ROI
Example: 25% × 10,000 users × $50 retention = $125,000 annual value
```

**Model Efficiency Savings**:
```
Tool Call Reduction × API Cost per Call × Query Volume = Cost Savings
Example: 30% × $0.02 × 50,000 calls/month = $300/month savings
```

## Decision Framework: What Success Looks Like

**Model Efficiency - SWITCH** if:
- ✓ ≥25% tool call reduction
- ✓ Satisfaction maintained (within 5%)
- ✓ Statistical significance on both metrics
- **Action**: Switch to Claude Sonnet for cost efficiency

### **Clear Failure Criteria**

**Tool Implementation - REJECT** if:
- ✗ <10% satisfaction improvement
- ✗ No statistical significance
- **Action**: Maintain `search_v1`, investigate search quality issues

**Model Efficiency - MAINTAIN STATUS QUO** if:
- ✗ <15% tool call reduction
- ✗ >10% satisfaction drop
- **Action**: Keep current model allocation

## What You've Accomplished

You've transformed your AI system from intuition-based configuration into a data-driven optimization engine with:

- **Scientific Rigor**: Falsifiable hypotheses with statistical thresholds
- **Clear Decision Framework**: Predefined success/failure criteria prevent post-hoc rationalization
- **Quantified Business Impact**: ROI calculations justify feature investments
- **Continuous Optimization**: Framework for ongoing experimentation with measurable outcomes

## Key Insights from Rigorous Experimentation

### **Common Results Patterns**

**Tool Implementation**:
- Advanced search typically shows 15-30% satisfaction improvement
- Benefits most pronounced on research and complex queries
- Cost justified when user retention value exceeds development investment

**Model Efficiency**:
- Claude often demonstrates 20-40% more efficient tool usage
- GPT-4 may show higher satisfaction but at higher resource cost
- Optimal choice depends on cost/quality trade-off for your user base

### **Statistical Learning**
