# Proving ROI with AI Agent Experiments

## Overview

You've built a multi-agent system with smart targeting and external research tools. But here's the reality: your stakeholders want proof, not promises. They need to see hard numbers showing that premium tools increase satisfaction, that expensive models deliver better results, and that enhanced security features justify their performance costs.

*Part 3 of 3 of the series: **Chaos to Clarity: Defensible AI Systems That Deliver on Your Goals***

The solution? **Controlled A/B experiments** with real user traffic and measurable outcomes. Instead of guessing which configurations work better, you'll run three strategic experiments that prove ROI: tool implementation impact, model efficiency analysis, and security enhancement costs. Use **LaunchDarkly experiments** to measure user satisfaction, tool efficiency, and cost-per-query across different configurations.

## What You'll Build Today

In the next 20 minutes, you'll prove the value of your AI system with:

- **Tool Implementation Experiments**: Measure search_v1 vs search_v2 impact on user satisfaction with controlled testing
- **Model Efficiency Analysis**: Compare Claude vs GPT-4 tool-calling precision and cost optimization
- **Security Configuration Study**: Quantify the performance impact of enhanced privacy settings
- **Real Traffic Simulation**: Generate authentic user interactions with feedback to power your experiments

## Prerequisites

> **⚠️ CRITICAL: Required Previous Steps**
>
> This tutorial builds directly on Parts 1 and 2. You **MUST** have completed:
> - **Part 1**: Basic multi-agent system with LaunchDarkly AI Configs
> - **Part 2**: Smart targeting with user segments and external research tools
> - **Working System**: All agents, tools, and targeting rules functioning correctly

You'll need:
- **Completed Parts 1 & 2**: Working multi-agent system with segmentation
- **Active LaunchDarkly Project**: With AI Configs and user segments from Part 2
- **API Keys**: All keys from previous parts (Anthropic, OpenAI, LaunchDarkly, Mistral)
- **Traffic Generator**: For realistic experiment data (included in this tutorial)

## Step 1: Set Up Experiment Framework (5 minutes)

LaunchDarkly experiments let you measure the real impact of different configurations on user behavior. You'll create three experiments that answer the most important questions about your AI system's value proposition.

Your experiment framework will track:
- **User Satisfaction**: Thumbs up/down feedback rates
- **Tool Efficiency**: Average tool calls per successful query
- **Cost Metrics**: Token usage and cost per interaction
- **Performance**: Response latency across configurations

Create your experimental setup:

```bash
# Generate realistic traffic for experiments
uv run python tools/traffic_generator.py --queries 200 --delay 1

# Monitor experiment results
uv run python tools/experiment_monitor.py --experiment tool-implementation
```

**Experiments You'll Run:**
- **Tool Implementation**: search_v1 (basic) vs search_v2 (advanced) with BM25 reranking
- **Model Efficiency**: Claude Sonnet vs GPT-4 with identical tool stacks
- **Security Impact**: Basic vs enhanced privacy configurations

## Step 2: Tool Implementation Experiment (5 minutes)

This experiment isolates the impact of your search improvements. By comparing search_v1 (basic search) against search_v2 (with semantic reranking), you'll prove whether advanced search features actually improve user satisfaction.

**Hypothesis**: Users with search_v2 + reranking will show higher satisfaction rates and need fewer tool calls to get good answers.

**Method**: Split paid users 50/50 between two tool configurations while keeping everything else identical (same model, same instructions, same user segments).

Configure the tool implementation experiment:

```bash
# Create LaunchDarkly experiment for tool comparison
uv run python bootstrap/create_tool_experiment.py
```

This creates:
- **Control Group**: search_v1 only (basic search)
- **Treatment Group**: search_v2 + reranking (advanced search)
- **Metrics**: User satisfaction, tool efficiency, response quality

## Step 3: Model Efficiency Analysis (5 minutes)

Different models have varying abilities to use tools effectively. This experiment compares Claude Sonnet vs GPT-4 with identical tool stacks to measure which model delivers better value through more efficient tool usage.

**Hypothesis**: Claude Sonnet will use tools more precisely, requiring fewer calls to achieve the same quality results, leading to better cost efficiency.

**Method**: Give both models the exact same tools and instructions, then measure tool-calling patterns and user satisfaction.

Set up the model efficiency experiment:

```bash
# Create model comparison experiment
uv run python bootstrap/create_model_experiment.py
```

This measures:
- **Tool Call Efficiency**: Average tools used per query
- **Success Rate**: Percentage of queries resolved without hitting tool limits
- **Cost Analysis**: Token usage and API costs per successful interaction
- **User Satisfaction**: Feedback rates across model types

## Step 4: Security Configuration Study (3 minutes)

Enhanced security often comes with performance trade-offs. This experiment quantifies the real impact of strict privacy settings on user experience and system performance.

**Hypothesis**: Enhanced security will increase response latency by 10-15% but won't significantly impact user satisfaction for privacy-conscious segments.

**Method**: Compare basic vs enhanced security configurations for EU users to measure the performance vs privacy trade-off.

Configure the security impact study:

```bash
# Create security configuration experiment
uv run python bootstrap/create_security_experiment.py
```

This tracks:
- **Response Latency**: Time to first response and total completion time
- **Processing Overhead**: Additional security screening impact
- **User Satisfaction**: Feedback rates with enhanced privacy features
- **Compliance Value**: Quantified privacy protection benefits

## Step 5: Generate Realistic Traffic (2 minutes)

Your experiments need authentic user interactions to produce meaningful results. The traffic generator simulates real user behavior patterns with diverse queries and realistic feedback.

Create experiment traffic:

```bash
# Generate diverse traffic across all user segments
uv run python tools/traffic_generator.py --queries 500 --delay 0.5 --experiment-mode

# Monitor real-time experiment metrics
uv run python tools/experiment_dashboard.py
```

The traffic generator creates:
- **Geographic Diversity**: EU and non-EU users with appropriate privacy expectations
- **Business Tier Mix**: Free and paid users with different tool access patterns
- **Query Variety**: Technical questions, research requests, and general inquiries
- **Realistic Feedback**: Smart simulation of user satisfaction based on response quality
